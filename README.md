# Proiect_PIBD_NodeJS

This is a CRUD web application developed in **Python** with the use of the **Django** framework on the backend and **HTML + CSS** on the frontend. This application successfully implements all CRUD functions: **create**, **read**, **update** and **delete** for a simple database consisting of 3 tables: **Lawyer**, **Client** and **Contract**.

***

The database for this project is relational and is implemented with the use of **PostgreSQL** ver. **16.1**. The connection between the Express server and the PG database is not ORM based, but instead it enables database operations using SQL queries.
